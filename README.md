### Overview

**MicroImprove** is a modern, web-based self-improvement platform centered around 9 science-inspired micro-experiments. The platform is designed to lower the barrier for self-growth by making experimentation lightweight, visually engaging, and deeply accessible. Each experiment encourages users to try out new brain-body habits in a playful, data-driven, and privacy-respecting environment.
